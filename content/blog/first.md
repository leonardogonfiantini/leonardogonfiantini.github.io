Hugo is amazing!

<!--more-->

This is my first post on my personal blog and I am incredibly excited about what I have accomplished using Hugo. 

Hugo is a fantastic framework for building static websites, as you can see from my site which was created using the framework. 
One area where Hugo could potentially improve is its documentation, specifically with regards to providing an easier tutorial for beginners in my opinion.
Aside from that, Hugo is pretty awesome and incredibly fast!

If you're curious, you can check out the code on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/leonardogonfiantini/leonardogonfiantini.github.io).
